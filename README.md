I’ve worked at two major tech-driven companies—VOIS and AT&T—supporting IoT platforms, mobile core networks, and connectivity infrastructure.
Alongside that, I’ve been consistently building frontend projects using Next.js 15  and modern React with hooks and functional components. On the backend, I’m comfortable with Node.js, Express, SQL
Sometimes, I write about my work on https://medium.com/@radovanbotik

I’m a frontend dev who’s all about Next.js 15—whether it’s SSR, SSG, API routes, or middleware. I usually stick to modern React with hooks and functional components, and I’ve even put together HTML email templates that don’t fall apart in Gmail, Outlook, or on people’s phones. On the backend side, I’m comfy with Express.js APIs, SQL, and Prisma (ORM), and I’m happy to bring in third-party libraries or APIs when they make sense. Occasionally, you’ll find me sharing my questionable wisdom through technical articles at [https://medium.com/@radovanbotik](https://medium.com/@radovanbotik).
